- All you have to do here is download the file and run it. 
- But before you do that change the webhook inside the script `YOUR_WEBHOOK`
and also download the `base64webhookencoder.py` to obfuscate your webhook a little bit
- This script works on windows only and it will install everything for you :)
the cam.py is the "hidden" version of the cam grabber.
- If you just want the raw cam grabbing then download `CamGrabber.py`
Here its the same. Download `base64webhookencoder.py` to obfuscate your webhook a bit and then copy it into the code where it says `YOUR_WEBHOOK`
- If you want it VERY simple then just use the `RAWcamgrabber.py` and paste your webhook inside there. The file will be small enough to be send through discord but there will be NOT A SINGLE BIT of "hiddeness" and "security"
