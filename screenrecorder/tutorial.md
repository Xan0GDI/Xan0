# Livestream in python (LIGHT)

1. Install the libraries using `pip install -r requiremens.txt`
2. run the python file
3. head to `http://localhost:3000/screen` to see your screen (sorry for the colours not fitting so good - this is the light version)
4. alternatively you can forward your localhost address using ngrok `ngrok http 3000`
5. from there you can also head to your stream using this syntax: https://**your-ngrok-address**/screen
